Hello Chris.  Here is your challenge, should you choose to accept it.

We could schedule some time for that weekend.
I'm flexible, Friday or Saturday is probably best.
Scope out the task a bit beforehand plz and let me know a good time.

By Sunday September 26th.
--> Make your first commit.
      Suggested Issues:
      --> Improve format for rules page, bring it in front of the other elements (relevant property is z-index)
      --> Identify another bug and fix it
--> Take a look at the cards in the Nationhood and Colonialism
    Decks and read the descriptions for some major powers and campaigns.
    If there are changes you think we should make you can list them here...:
--> Identify a feature or part you would like to work on... examples...
    --> gathering art or information for dataset
    --> making up cards or decks
    --> finding or making iconset
    --> desinging elements like menus/cards
    --> making decisions about colors and designs
    --> redesigning ux elements
    --> creating ai system
    --> creating scoreboard system
    --> creating action feedback system
    --> on-map feedback system
    / notification system / end-game stats system
      -- probably want to do all of these in the end.
    -->challenging but highly valuable one, start making it look good on mobile.
